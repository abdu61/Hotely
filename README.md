## [Version Control and Bug Tracking](#version)
For open source projects, GitHub offers free public version control hosting. This involves creating an online, publicly accessible version controlled repository from which anybody may view the project's resources and get updates. For both users and developers, a version control repository indicates that the project is trying to provide resources so that everyone can contribute.GitHub is a reasonable option for the majority of projects, even though it's not the sole or even the best one.The project's bug tracker is in the same boat. A bug tracking system's value extends beyond its regular utility to developers to include the implications it holds for project observers. An accessible bug database is, in the opinion of many, one of the most compelling indicators that a project should be.



## Communication Channels:
As for any project communication is one of the backbones of the project. And we use mainly two platforms **Github issues** and **Discord**.
-	GitHub Issues: This is a built-in feature of GitHub that allows users to report bugs, request features, ask questions, and provide feedback on a project. GitHub Issues can be organized with labels, milestones, and projects, and can be linked to pull requests and commits. GitHub Issues are suitable for conversations that are related to the code and need to be tracked and resolved.

-	Discord: This is a chat and voice platform that allows users to create and join servers for various topics and communities. Discord can be integrated with GitHub using webhooks, bots, or services like Zapier to send notifications, updates, and commands for a project. We use Discord for every other communication including quick chat, future builds, more detailed interaction etc.



## Documentation

#### Known Issues:
This document is incomplete and may contain errors or inaccuracies. Some of the known issues are:
-	The App does not have any security validation
-	The App have issues with adapting to Tablet Screens



## Developer Guidelines:
This document provides best practices for developing, testing, and deploying the Hotel Management Application(HMA) on our GitHub. Whether you are beginner or experienced we got you covered on how to contribute to our Project.

#### Code Style and Formatting:
The HMA uses following languages:
-	HTML, CSS and JavaScript
-	Angular and Ionic Components

#### We use the following coding practice:
-	Format code with consistent spaces and indents. Use a tool like [Prettier] to do it automatically.
-	End statements with semicolons and avoid auto-insertion.
-	Name variables, functions, and classes clearly and descriptively. Use camelCase for variables and functions, and Pascal Case for classes.
-	Use single quotes for strings, unless you need double quotes for interpolation or escaping.
-	Use strict equality operators (=== and !==) to compare values, unless you need type coercion.
-	Enclose code blocks with braces ({}). Put the opening brace on the same line as the statement, and the closing brace on a new line.
-	Comment your code to explain its logic and purpose, especially if it is complex or not obvious. Use // for single-line comments and /* â€¦ */ for multi-line comments.
-	Use modern JavaScript features, such as let, const, arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring.



## Develper Documentation:
You can refer to Documentation and Developer guidelines along with this. Here we will deep dive into how our whole process works:

#### Contribution
To contribute to the app, you can follow these steps:
-	Fork the open source Ionic app repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine.
-	Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix, named as feature/<feature-name> or bugfix/<bug-id>, and branch off from the develop branch.
-	Write your code and tests, following the coding standards and conventions of the project.
-	Commit and push your changes to your forked repository, using clear and descriptive messages.
-	Create a pull request to merge your branch into the develop branch of the original repository. The pull request should have a clear and descriptive title and a detailed description of the changes. You should also assign a reviewer to review your code and approve the merge.

#### Branching and Merging:
The HMA uses â€˜GitFlowâ€™ workflow The Main Branches are:
-	main/master: Stable and production-ready code. Only authorized developers can merge into it.
-	feature: New features or enhancements. Each feature has its own branch, named as feature/<feature-name>, from develop.
-	bugfix: Bugs or errors. Each bugfix has its own branch, named as bugfix/<bug-id>, from develop.
-	hotfix: Critical bugs or issues in master. Each hotfix has its own branch, named as hotfix/<hotfix-id>, from master.

When you finish a feature or a bugfix, create a pull request to merge into develop. The pull request should have a clear title and description, and a reviewer to approve it.

#### Testing and Debugging:
-	Test your app with unit, end-to-end, and manual tests. Use tools like [Jasmine], [Protractor], or [Cypress] to write and run tests. Follow the [Arrange-Act-Assert] pattern and use code coverage tools.
-	Debug your app with browser dev tools, such as [Chrome DevTools] or [Safari Web Inspector], or code editors, such as [Visual Studio Code]. Use commands like [ionic serve], [ionic cordova run], [ionic capacitor run], [ionic doctor], and [ionic monitor] to run and debug your app on different platforms and devices.

#### Deployment and Maintenance:
We use tools and services to build, test, and deploy your app on different platforms and devices, such as:
-	<b>Appflow:</b> A cloud-based service to generate web and native builds, push live updates, publish to app stores, and automate the process.
-	<b>Ionic Advisory:</b> A service to get expert help and guidance for your Ionic development. Get tailored recommendations, active maintenance, and access to Ionic experts.

#### Bug Tracking Process:
If you found a bug. You can quickly create a issue by following
- Goto "Bug fix" Branch. If it severe/critical Goto "hotfix" branch
- Raise a issue with all the details. It would be better to give detailed information
- Additionally you can chat through Discord after raising a issue this way our developers and community will know the bug better and come up with a fix




## User Characterstics and Screenshots:
### Characterstics:
